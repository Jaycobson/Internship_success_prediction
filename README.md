# Internship_success_prediction

This project is a solution to the machine learning test organized by the Climdes team. 

In this project, I simulated a data that uses some features and a target. It is a classification probem because we are trying to predict if an intern is going to be successful or not during the internship.

Thank you for the opportunity to show case my machine learning skills.
